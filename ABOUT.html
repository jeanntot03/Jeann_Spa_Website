<center><h1>HISTORY OF THE COMPANY</h1><center>
<center><p style=color:Green>What started out as a small spa business back in 2001 has grown over the years into a sprawling hectare of gardens, offering cozy accommodations, food and beverage services, wellness treatments, spa services, team building programs, weddings and corporate events among the lush greenery known as  Wellness Village.
In 2015, the management established Jeann Farmacy, an organic farm catering to our expanding requirements for pesticide-free vegetables in Jeann’s restaurant. Jeann Farmacy is now a Department of Tourism accredited farm tourism destination. its vegetable plots are shaped like the different systems of the body and planted with the healing herbs and vegetables best suited for each body system/organ.
Located deep amidst coffee orchards, both Wellness Village and Jeann Farmacy offer a distinctive brand of “Ecotherapy” or healing by and through nature. We provide a unique Filipino wellness experience, like our iconic Ifugao native huts and Filipino themed decor, our therapeutic Filipino themed spa treatments, our Filipino fusion cuisine in our restaurant The Farmer’s Table and our medicinal plants-themed farming experience.

Since our inception, Jeann's Spa has been leader in promoting environmentally sustainable practices within the spa community.  We have designed every aspect of your experience to minimize our impact on the environment, from our building materials to the products we use to our commitment to recycling and composting. We’re also a founding member of the Green Spa Network, a non-profit trade organization whose mission is dedicated to bringing sustainability practices to the spa industry.

Healing, Wellness and Vitality
Our intention has always been to offer an experience that goes beyond relaxation. Our services are designed to offer true healing and to provide health benefits that sustain your body, mind, and spirit in your everyday journey. Beyond the uniqueness of our offerings—such as our one-of-a-kind Cedar Enzyme Bath—this commitment extends to the close attention we give to making you feel at home, comfortable, and taken care of. Communion with nature, meditation, and sound therapy are more experiences that we offer our guests to foster mental clarity.
